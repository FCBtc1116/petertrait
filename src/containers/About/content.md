Currently based in Bath/London working as a user experience and interface designer at pebble {code} – digital innovation consultancy.

Having gained a first-class honours degree in graphic design at the University of Southampton. I am an agile designer with a focus on an interactive and refined process.

Experienced with clients ranging from global corporations to family firms. My work is based on minimal principles with a well thought out theory behind them. The focus of my work varies between mediums ranging from user experience and interfaces, web design and development, branding, typography and print.

A passion for feedback and discussions on design helps maintain multiple perspectives – seeing it as the key to working agile and efficiently – resulting in refined outcomes.
