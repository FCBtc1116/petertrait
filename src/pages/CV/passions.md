A lot of my passion is around learning. Whether it's learning more about design and development or a new recipe to cook. Learning Norwegian is a newly found passion and it's rather exciting.

Outside of learning, I enjoy photographing with a set of compact lenses armed with a wide aperture. Technology aside, I like to go running and cycling as far from the city as my body can handle.
