Working with a team of researchers and user experience designers, I was involved with the visual design of deliverables, wireframe production and the final delivery of specs for development. Working with clients including National Grid, Nomura, HSBC, IUCN and NG Bailey.

Beyond managing the deliverables, I also developed a new way of creating specs for internal and external use. Making a more efficient document style for developers and designers combined.
