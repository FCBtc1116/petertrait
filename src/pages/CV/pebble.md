Working within a team of developers and designers, I am involved from initial ideas, workshops, prototyping and designing, through to the actual building and creating of the product itself – within a production environment. Clients include AstraZeneca, Pearson, National Express and Lloyds Banking Group.

Hack days and workshops are a big part of the job, where innovative ideas are generated around a topic and selected ideas are then designed and built within a single day. This results in fully working prototypes that can test the validity of the initial ideas – whilst also having fun through collaboration.
