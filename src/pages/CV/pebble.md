Working within a team of developers and designers, Peter is involved from initial ideas, prototyping and designing, through to the actual building and creating of the product itself. Clients include AstraZeneca, Pearson, National Express and Lloyds Banking Group.

Hack days and workshops are a big part of the job, where innovative ideas are generated around a topic for the client and selected ideas are then designed and built within a single day. This results in fully working prototypes that can test the validity of the initial ideas.
