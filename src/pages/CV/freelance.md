Iâ€™ve teamed up with a range of consultancies including pebble {code} (software/app design and development), Electronic Ink (design research consultancy) and Tobias & Tobias (user experience consultancy). Whilst also working as the sole designer/developer with clients on a one-to-one basis, from initial talks to final deliverables. Through user-centered design and gathering feedback where possible, that feedback helps develop the product through an iterative process, resulting in a refined deliverable.

The services I provide include; wireframing, prototyping, user flows, user experience and product design, frontend development and final launching of the product. I've worked with a range of clients including Intel, AstraZeneca, MedImmune, EDF Energy, The World Bank and APM Technologies.
