Involved from the concept/wireframe stage through to the management of the final deliverables and their visual and user experience design. Working with clients including Intel, AstraZeneca, MedImmune, EDF Energy, The World Bank and APM Technologies.

I’ve teamed up with consultants including pebble {code} (software/app design and development), Electronic Ink (design research consultancy) and Tobias & Tobias (user experience consultancy) and working alone with clients on a one-to-one basis, from initial talks to final deliverables. I have a strong willingness to learn from the feedback of my peers and others. Function is a key element to my work – once the functional experience has been developed and tested, a visual design system can be applied and developed through an iterative process, resulting in a refined deliverable.
