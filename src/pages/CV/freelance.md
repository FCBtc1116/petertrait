Involved from the concept/wireframe stage through to the management of the final deliverables and their visual and user experience design. Working with clients including Intel, AstraZeneca, MedImmune, EDF Energy, The World Bank and APM Technologies.

Peter has teamed up with consultants including pebble {code} (software/app design and development), Electronic Ink (design research consultancy) and Tobias & Tobias (user experience consultancy) and working alone with clients on a one-to-one basis, from initial talks to final deliverables. Peter is always willing to learn from the feedback of his peers and others. Function is the key element to his work â€“ once the functional experience has been developed, the visual design is applied through an iterative process, resulting in a refined deliverable.
