Highly experienced with design software including Adobe Creative Suite and Sketch.

I have excellent knowledge of frontend development including HTML/CSS. Beyond just CSS, I am comfortable in new technology such as CSS Modules and Javascript inline styling. I am confident in understanding documentation when introducing a new framework or library. I have strong knowledge of frontend Javascript including React. Terminal and Git are an essential tool within my process.

Through my experimentation in typeface making, I know my way around Glyphs. Other more obscure skills include oil painting.
