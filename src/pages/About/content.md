I’m Peter, currently based in Bath/London working as a user experience and interface designer at pebble {code} – a digital innovation consultancy.

Having gained a first-class honours degree in graphic design at the University of Southampton, I’ve established a focus on an interactive and refined process.

Experienced with clients ranging from global corporations to family firms, including: Intel, AstraZeneca, Pearson, HSBC, National Grid, Lloyds Banking Group, IUCN, National Express, EDF, The World Bank, NG Bailey and APM Technologies.

Minimal principles are the basis to my work, with a well thought out theory behind them. The focus of my work varies between mediums ranging from; user experience and interfaces, web design and development, branding, typography and print.

My belief and passion for feedback and discussions on design helps maintain multiple perspectives – seeing it as the key to working agile and efficiently – resulting in refined outcomes.
