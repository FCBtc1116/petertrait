Having gained a first-class honours degree in graphic design at the University of Southampton, I’ve established a focus on an interactive and refined process.

Minimal principles are the basis to my work, with a well thought out theory behind them. The focus of my work varies between mediums ranging from; user experience and interfaces, web design and development, branding, typography and print.

My belief and passion for feedback and discussions on design helps maintain multiple perspectives – seeing it as the key to working agile and efficiently – resulting in refined outcomes.
