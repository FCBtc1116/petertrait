Metrik is an ongoing side project I don't plan to finish soon. The process has been long and and I have learn't a huge amount in the process.

Check out the video below of a talk I gave at pebble {code} on how and why I created a typeface. If you would like to get involved and start testing Metrik out, please do get in contact!
