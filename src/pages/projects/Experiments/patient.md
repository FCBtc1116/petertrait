There is a growing desire to engage cancer patients throughout their treatment. AstraZeneca held a two day hackathon to explore ideas around improving the relationship between Patient, Doctor and Pharmaceutical companies that provide the treatment.

Our team created an application that gave patients the ability to track the timeline of their treatment and receive updates remotely from their doctor. The timeline included features such as information about upcoming appointments and ability to share the timeline with family.

Another core feature allowed patients to share their feelings at certain points within their treatment. All user feelings could then be averaged out to give patients future insights into what feelings to expect at certain parts of their treatment.
