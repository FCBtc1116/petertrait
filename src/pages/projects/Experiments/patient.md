There is a growing desire to engage cancer patients throughout their treatment. AstraZeneca held a two day hackathon to try and explore ideas around to go about improve the relationship between Patient, Doctor and Pharmaceutical companies that provide the treatment.

Another core feature allowed patients to share their feelings at certain points within their treatment. The average of all user feelings could then be averaged out to give patients insights into what feelings to expect at certain parts of their treatment.
