At a hackday at pebble {code} which was themed around games, our team decided to experiment with iBeacons. iBeacons are a great way to track where a device is by using sensors. Our idea was to create curling with phones.

Our team projected the curling court design onto the ground and phones were slid across the ground – mimicking curling stones. Spectators could see the position of the phones on their devices and interact with the game with sound effects such as boos and cheers.
