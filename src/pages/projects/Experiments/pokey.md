Pokey was an experimentation in how to create a font file. I wanted to create a simple font targeted at younger children who are bored of comic sans...

I started by drawing the glyphs out on paper before scanning and tweaking with Illustrator. After Illustrator, I created the font file with Glyphs â€“ within Glyphs I could start to tweak more detailed aspects such as kerning.
