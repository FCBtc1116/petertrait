Each employee at AstraZeneca juggle a handful of profiles – this led to varying contact details and no central source for user data.

The People Search app created a central source of truth for user data and gave users the ability to easily search across the company and guarantee accurate results. Now multiple profiles can pull in data from this central source – lightening the workload of AstraZeneca employees who had to keep each of their profiles up to date manually.
