Enterprise software is often ridiculed for it's bloated experience, but it doesn't have to be that way. This application set out to be consumer grade. Using Titanium as the development language, the prototype could quickly be quickly deployed as native iOS code.

The application was designed from the ground up to focus around the user. The initial onboarding guides the user to take a profile picture. A profile picture is vital for a company the size of AstraZeneca where people can search a name and get hundreds of results back â€“ without a profile picture those results verge on useless.

The application had a core feature set (no feature creep here) that focused around people. Features included favourites, video/phone calling, user profiles and a fast people search.
