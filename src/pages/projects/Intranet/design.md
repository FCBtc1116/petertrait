Traditionally intranets just aren't very good, they quickly become abandoned with old information and  become a burden to maintain. Instead we decided to create an MVP to initiate enthusiasm for a product that AstraZeneca can continuously improve.

Instead of the tradition intranet of message boards, weather widgets and whatever other widget can be shoehorned in – the first release of this platform was simply news. News is a great way for a global company to communicate across different countries. A Chinese reader can feel more engaged with the company if they are reading daily news of what's happening in Sweden for example.

Product mapping, wireframing and prototyping led to the initial MVP. The MVP opened up the chance to user-test and see where the product could be validated and enhanced further. Throughout this we had to maintain a strong vision of our goal to improve communication and engagement – not to create another abandoned intranet behemoth.
