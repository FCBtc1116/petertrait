The traffic coming through to the pebble {code} website grew an astonishing amount, increasing by 666%! This was partly down to the interactive 404 page I created and went kinda "viral".

The 404 page was inspired by 90's desktops such as the original classic Mac OS. The page was fully interactive, including movable windows, clickable folder icons and interactive modals. The Finder replicated the global navigation ensuring users would always find their way back to the pebble {code} website.
