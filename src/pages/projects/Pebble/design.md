It was key to make the website standout from other consultancies, this was done through vibrant colours, a soft typeface choice and illustrations that were full of depth. The website refresh brought in a new typeface called Brandon Text. Originally pebble has four different typefaces making designs overly complicated and lacking focus.

Brandon Text brought a soft look whilst still being unique. The use of large titles helped draw the attention immediately to visitors of the site.
