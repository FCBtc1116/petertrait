The geometric shapes that make up each glyph within Metrik give a distinctive look and feel. The purpose of Metrik is to be a display typeface that has an impact, perfect for brand design.

Using techniques learn’t within the software industry, I plan on releasing each of the font weights as they are completed – instead of one final major release. I hope to seek feedback which can then influence the continuous delivery of updates.
