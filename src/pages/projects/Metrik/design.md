Through observing how National Express measured satisfaction across their trains and stations, we were able to find areas to improve. After wireframing, we started prototyping (in React) a webapp which could be tested out in the field by a real user.

The core feature we set out to include was the ability to give contextual content dependent on the user's location. If a user was based in Farringdon where the station only has one platform, then only display that information within the app. Other features included the ability to leave comments and photos taken directly within the app.

The application was built to make the process of surveying as efficiently as possible. Closing the app would save the current progress, this combined with the application working across all platforms, made environment switching seamless.
