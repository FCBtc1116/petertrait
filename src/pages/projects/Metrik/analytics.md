National Express originally had no easy way of tracking previous surveys carried out by their employees. With the creation of this app we automated this analysis process. Every survey uploaded would generate a report. This report would allow National Express to retrospectively look back at a train or station past history and see an overall progress or view an individual survey.

This kind of data helped National Express keep track of the progress of each station and see where improvements could be made.
