Each employee as AstraZeneca has to juggle a handful of profiles – this led to varying contact details and no central source for user data.

People Search app created a central source of truth for user data and gave users the ability to easily search across the company and guarantee accurate results. Now multiple profiles can pull in data from this central source – taking away the manual work from AstraZeneca employees whom had to keep each of their profiles up to date.
