Through observing how National Express measured satisfaction, areas which could be improved became apparent. After wireframing, a prototyping (in React) webapp was tested out in the field by real end users.

The core feature was the ability to give contextual content dependent on the user's location. If a user was based in Farringdon where the station only has one platform, then only display that relevant information within the app. Other features included the ability to leave comments and photos taken directly within the app.

The application was built to make the process of surveying as efficient as possible. Closing the app would save the current progress, this combined with the application working across all platforms, made environment switching seamless.
