Templars Weddings is a company that organises weddings using local providers and has it's own impressive barn venues. The client came to me with a great product but no website to promote with. We sat down to discuss the core purpose of the website and what values of the product we wanted to shout about.

The website is full of beautiful imagery and elegant typography. The entire website's content is managed through Wordpress including the Blog. The blog includes articles which load directly into the page meaning no page loads!
