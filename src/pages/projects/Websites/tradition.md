New Tradition are a brand communications consultancy. Their brief was to create a new website that focused on their strong writing and brand communication ability. The vision was to focus on strong typography and let the words speak for themselves. The clients took great pride in their articles and creating templates for the different types of content helped give that sense of detail to the reader.

The website was built on the file-based CMS, Kirby. Kirby was ideal for the clients as a quick and effortless way to create articles whilst making the website lightweight and performant.
