Current safety in the workplace courses consist of 800+ powerpoint slides shoved into two full working days. Employees are often forced into the course and made to leave work for these two days.

Our aim was to bring some enjoyment back into learning and make the course more insightful for both employers and employees â€“ whilst still being IOSH accredited.
