Through gamification quick quiz called Fasttrack was created which concludes each module. Fasttrack helped break up heavy amounts of content with fun and varied games, but also ensured students were learning the content.

The course had to meet standards set by IOSH (safety regulation board) for accreditation. Fasttrack was made up of multiple games, ranging from drag and drop into the missing fields, fruit ninja style slashing of incorrect answers or stack the answers in the correct order.

Each game had their own brand, including targeted voiceovers encouraging the students to fully engage with the course.
