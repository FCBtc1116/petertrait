Learning doesn't have to be boring. Education courses tend to consist of clipart illustrations and endless bullet points. We wanted to change this into a more enjoyable experience. With talking head videos, users have far less content to read and feel more engaged with lively actors talking directly to them.

Whilst leading art direction of the entire product, the aim of the videos was to ensure a good level of humour was maintained without interrupting the educational aspect of the content.
