AstraZeneca is one of the largest Pharmaceutical companies in the world. The company is spread across multiple continents with over 80,000 employees that speak a multitude of languages. This scenario resulted in each internal business sector, country and pretty much any group creating their own communication system that would work for their needs.

There was no centralised way for the company to communicate or share insights.
