The name "Nucleus" was given for the platform. This further focused on how the platform aimed to become a centralised place for all of AstraZeneca. Gone are the days of multiple mini intranets with their own competing visions, now all of AstraZeneca can build upon the Nucleus branding system.

The branding aimed to be a new vibrant start for AstraZeneca. By opting for bright colours that were a step away from AstraZeneca's external facing brand, Nucleus became it's own product.

The main internal systems were unified under Nucleus, saving AstraZeneca millions of pounds in server costs alone. Nucleus became an instant success viewed daily by 80,000 users.
