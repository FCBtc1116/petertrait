The name "Nucleus" was given for the platform. This further focused on how the platform aimed to become a centralised place for all of AstraZeneca. Gone are the days of multiple mini intranets with their own competing visions, now all of AstraZeneca can build upon the Nucleus branding system.

The branding focused around a new vibrant start for AstraZeneca. By opting for vibrant colours that were a step away from AstraZeneca's external facing brand, Nucleus became it's own product.

Nucleus became an instant success â€“ viewed daily by 80,000 users and with the main internal systems all now come under the Nucleus umbrella.
