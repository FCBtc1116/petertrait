Using Atomic design as the core philosophy to the platform architecture, a system was created which allowed pages to be made up of a series of components. We created the idea of "callouts" â€“ callouts are blocks of content that look like cards and allow for users to access content quickly.

Multiple components can fit into each other and the design of these components depend on the context. A component dropped into a callout will generally show snippets of content, whereas the content of a component nested within a full page will be more detailed.
