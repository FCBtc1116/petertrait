Traditionally intranets just aren't very good, they quickly become abandoned with old information and become a burden to maintain. Instead an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) was developed to initiate enthusiasm for a product that AstraZeneca can continuously improve.

Instead of traditional intranets filled with message boards, weather widgets and whatever other widget can be shoehorned in â€“ the first release of this platform was just news. News is a great way for a global company to communicate across different countries and build culture.

The MVP opened up the chance to user-test and validate the product whilst also observe where the product could be enhanced further. Throughout, the goal was to improve communication and engagement, not to create another graveyard of outdated knowledge.
