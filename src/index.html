            <h4>UI/UX Designer</h4>
            <p>Working within a team of developers and designers, I am involved from initial ideas, prototyping and designing, through to the actual building and creating of the product itself. Clients include AstraZeneca, Pearson and Lloyds Banking Group.</p>
            <p>Hack days and workshops are a big part of the job, where innovative ideas are generated around a topic for the client and selected ideas are then designed and built within a single day. This results in fully working prototypes that can test the validity of the initial ideas.</p>

            <p>Involved from the concept/wireframe stage through to the management of the final deliverables and their visual and user experience design. Working with clients including Intel, AstraZeneca, WZO, EDF and APM Technologies.</p>
            <p>Peter has teamed up with consultants including pebble {code} (software/app design and development), Electronic Ink (design research consultancy) and Tobias &amp; Tobias (user experience consultancy) and working alone with clients on a one-to-one basis, from initial talks to final deliverables. Peter is always willing to learn from the feedback of his peers and others. Function is the key element to his work – once the functional experience has been developed, the visual design is applied through an iterative process, resulting in a refined deliverable.</p>
