Text: 

The core to this typeface is it's grid that each letterform is built upon. This very simple structure creates a simple stroke that turns into an easy-to-read letter.

Suitable only as a display face, and built for a unique brand that wants to stand out as forward thinking and a refined approach to their work.  

Only the minimal amount of components are created to each letter. Parts to each letter have been analysed and tested to create the most refined and cut down shape.
