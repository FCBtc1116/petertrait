Through following fellow students, events and groups; users can discover events beyond just searching through lists of results.

Recieving over ten emails a day which lacked interaction and engagement led to a want to solve how students’ passion for learning and exploring without the use of mundane and generic blanket emails sent out daily.

Univents builds on the community spirit of campuses and aims to let users to help moderate and add events which then other students can follow. Groups allows students to keep a selection of events together. Example being if the Edinburgh University SU President wanted to create a Group that was entirely related to all SU events then he could help spread the word to the right demographic with ease simply by adding other peoples’ created events to that group.
