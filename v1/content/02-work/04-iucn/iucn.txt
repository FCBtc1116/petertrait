The aim of the new section of the IUCN Red List was to welcome the general public and to encourage their interaction with an important subject. 

Making complex data from IUCNâ€™s largest database in the world simple was made possible by prioritising what content should be made available to the user. Imagery was important in helping non-experts to understand each species. Iconography was created for each species and habitat to placehold where there was no imagery within the database. This resulted in every species page contained helpful profile picture to help the user instantly recognise using image recognition.

This project was completed with Electronic Ink, where I created the aesthetics, specs and wireframes using research gathered. View the website live at discover.iucnredlist.org.
