Interaction with the typeface leads to better understanding of itâ€™s characteristics and capabilities

ISTD set the brief of creating a new way of specifying type. This immediately led to the questions of how designers use type and how do they decide on typefaces when designing.

Before making purchases the user will want to know what the possibilities are. The specimens created looked at letter users experiment and play with the typeface. This was possible by creating an interactive website that acts as an inspiration tool with different sections showing the typeface in a range of possible ways it could be used.
