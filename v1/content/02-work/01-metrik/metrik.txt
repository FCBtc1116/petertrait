A typeface built around its creators personal ethos.

A typeface built around its creators personal ethos.

Metrik is a current work in progress with more weights and highly detailed refinement in the pipeline. The initial workings have created a unique typeface that is highly distinguishable from other geometric typefaces currently on the market. The use of serifs on certain letters creates an unusual character whilst also adding legibility to letters that struggle at smaller sizes.

Built for branding and for display use. Future refinement may lead to a book weight with the purpose of better legibility at smaller sizes. Classic fonts including Futura are favourites among designers – Metrik looks to become an alternative to these where unique style is desirable.
