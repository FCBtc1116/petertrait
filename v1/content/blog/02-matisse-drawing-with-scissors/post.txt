###A review of a review

Walking through the modern glass doors into the Matisse exhibition in Winchester’s Discovery Centre, I felt a sense of emptiness. I look around the gallery to see these masterpieces that Matisse is well known for during his latter years of his life, but at first glance they are not there. It is only as I continue walking closer to these small frames 70% filled with the lithographed replicas of Matisse’s work, do I see glimpses of bright coloured fun. Malcolm Hebron in his review of the exhibition described how there was a ‘passionate life lived within the frame’ - I agree to an extent, when focusing solely on a piece you can feel a real ‘fun-time’ that Matisse must have had. However, that’s as far as it goes, the pieces are simply to small where I believe it limits the impact of how colourful these pieces are. The greatness of these scissor cut pieces is the rough edges and overlapping of colours, this is lost when the piece has been scaled down to such an extent that the edges are no long noticeable and the overlapping colours look accidental.

Hebron continues onto to describe how he felt a ‘darker note’ within some of the works. There was this feeling amongst many of the pieces. They were not collated together, but mixed in with the majority of the multi-coloured pieces. It appeared to be a timeline of how Matisse felt during his time towards the end of his life, with highs and lows. Hebron has a similar view describing the show as ‘A final and glorious leave-taking.’ On Hebron’s note I believe the show had a sense of finale, a ending show of Matisse’s final thoughts.

The far end of the gallery has a table and chairs with a collection of materials and cutouts to help let people experiment with their own artworks. The idea is great, especially with all the inspiration that surrounds the table. Hebron describes it as the best way to enjoy the cutouts. I agree the idea is great, but not the best - it could have been much more. Why not let people use the far wall? Create a blank canvas and let people truly experience the artwork the same way that Matisse would have. This I believe sums up the entire exhibition - the work by Matisse is inspiring and experimental, but the gallery itself is simply frames in order, grid layout with a table in the corner. There was no experimentation. Hebron uses the words ‘perfect Mediterranean’ to describe the exhibition - all I could see when looking back as I exit is four cream walls with some small frames which I couldn’t make out what were inside.

###Lacking that authentic spark
Considering that the originals were created on entire walls in enormous scale, the room would have been lit with wonderful colour, the textures of all the different cutouts on top of each other. The ability to look around and have a panoramic of wonderful colours. It’s quite the contrast to the tiny frames that encapsulate these wonderfully Matisse pieces.
