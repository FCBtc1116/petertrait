###Finalising the letterforms.

Before sharing Mino with Dribbble, I had already developed the grid that each letter would be based upon. Each letter is based on this minimal yet robust grid which creates a unique rounded shape.

###Creating a brand
For typefaces it is important to create a brand which can give an example usage for users. Making the example imagery help fit the purpose that the typeface was intended for is vital. A user may want help in understanding what that typeface could be used for.

Within these screenshots I tried out exploring Mino as a 'modern' typeface that has a space feel to it. In the end I decided to leave this brand, deciding it wasn't quie right for the minimal shapes that Mino is made up of. I went down a more minimal and flat style that can be seen in more detail on the [Mino case study](/case-studies/mino) page.
