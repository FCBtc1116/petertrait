    			<p>He has gained the experience of working as a freelance contractor, teaming up with consultants including for Pebble {Code} (Software and app design and development), Electronic Ink (Design Research Consultancy) and Tobias &amp; Tobias (User Experience Consultancy) or working alone with clients on a one-to-one basis, from initial talks to final deliverables. Peter is always willing to learn from the feedback of his peers and others.
